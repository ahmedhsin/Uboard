**UBoard: Task Management Platform**

**Project Overview**

uBoard is a management platform that empowers individuals and teams to organize, collaborate, and streamline their workflows effectively. It offers a comprehensive suite of features for creating and managing tasks, boards, topics, and sub-topics, fostering efficient project execution.

**Key Functionalities**

-   **User Management:**
    -   Create user accounts and log in securely.
-   **Board Management:**
    -   Create boards with customizable titles, descriptions, and categories.
    -   Organize tasks within boards for structured project management.
-   **Topic Management:**
    -   Create topics within boards, each with a title, description, and category.
    -   Nest sub-topics for hierarchical organization within boards.
-   **Task Management:**
    -   Create tasks within topics, specifying titles, descriptions, categories, content, completion status (fished), and notification preferences.
-   **Favoriting:**
    -   Users can mark boards, topics, and tasks as favorites for quick access.
-   **Team Collaboration:**
    -   Board owners can invite members to collaborate, allowing them to add or remove topics and tasks as required.

**Tech Stack**

-   **Backend:**
    -   **Node.js:**  JavaScript runtime environment for server-side operations.
    -   **Express Framework:**  Enables building robust and scalable RESTful APIs.
    -   **TypeScript:**  Superset of JavaScript for static typing and improved maintainability.
-   **Database:**
    -   **MongoDB:**  NoSQL database offering flexibility and scalability for data storage.
    -   **Mongoose:**  ODM (Object Data Modeling) for interacting with MongoDB using an object-oriented approach.
-   **Security and Validation:**
    -   **Express Validator:**  Streamlines input validation and authorization handling.
    -   **Passport.js:**  Provides authentication middleware for user login and session management.
-   **API Documentation:**
    -   **Swagger-Express:**  Generates interactive API documentation for easy integration and reference.
    
**Backend Architecture (Node.js/Express):**

-   **Models:**
    -   Represent the data entities like Users, Boards, Topics, Tasks, etc. These models define the data structure and any associated database interactions using Mongoose (ODM).
-   **Controllers:**
    -   Handle incoming API requests based on their endpoints (URLs) and HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
    -   They interact with models to retrieve, create, update, or delete data.
    -   They also handle user authentication and authorization with Passport.js.
-   **Services:**
    -   Can encapsulate reusable business logic related to specific functionalities (e.g., sending notifications, managing board permissions).
    -   They interact with models and other services for complex operations.

**Entity-Based Routes:**

-   Create separate route groups (using Express router objects) for each entity:
    
    -   Users (`/users`)
    -   Boards (`/boards`)
    -   Topics (`/topics`)
    -   Tasks (`/tasks`)

**Getting Started**

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    -   Node.js (version 14 or later) and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. You can find installation instructions at  [https://nodejs.org/en](https://nodejs.org/en).
2.  **Clone the Repository:**
    
    Bash
    
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/uBoard.git
    
    ```
    

    
3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    
    Bash
    
    ```
    cd uBoard
    npm install
    
    ```
    

    
4.  **Database Setup:**
    -   Set up a MongoDB instance locally or on a cloud provider.
    -   Configure the database connection details in the appropriate environment variable file (e.g.,  `.env`  or similar).
5.  **Start the Server For Devlopment:**
    
    Bash
    
    ```
    npm run dev
    
    ```
    

    

This will start the uBoard server, typically listening on port 8000 (adjust if needed). You can then access the API documentation (generated by Swagger-Express) at `http://localhost:8000/api-docs`.

**Usage**

uBoard provides a RESTful API for interacting with its functionalities. The specific API endpoints and their usage will be documented within the generated Swagger documentation.

## Improved ToDo List for uBoard:

**High Priority:**

1.  **Testing:**
    -   **Implement and fix service tests:**  Ensure services function as expected.
    -   **Implement endpoint tests:**  Verify API endpoints behave correctly.
2.  **Error Handling:**
    -   **Improve error handling:**  Provide more informative error messages and use appropriate status codes for different error scenarios.

**Medium Priority:**

-   **Code Readability:**
    -   **Enhance code readability:**
        -   Use consistent indentation and formatting.
        -   Add clear and concise comments to explain complex logic.
        -   Consider code refactoring for maintainability.

**Low Priority (Future Enhancements):**

-   **Private Boards:**
    -   **Enable private boards functionality:**  Allow board owners to restrict access.
-   **Authentication Features:**
    -   **Implement forgot password functionality:**  Enable users to reset lost passwords.
    -   **Implement email verification:**  Enhance user registration security.

**Deployment:**

-   **Deployment on a server:**  Plan for deployment to a production environment for broader accessibility. This might involve additional tasks like server configuration, containerization, and environment setup.

**Separate Frontend:**

-   **Frontend development:**  Plan for developing a separate frontend application to interact with the uBoard API. This is typically done using a framework like React, Angular, or Vue.js.

I hope this enhanced README provides a clear and informative guide for using uBoard!
